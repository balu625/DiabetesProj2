Project Title 

Diabetes detection 

Diabetes detection using machine learning involves developing predictive models that can identify individuals at risk of diabetes based on clinical and lifestyle data. Commonly used datasets (like the PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset) include features such as age, BMI, glucose levels, insulin levels, and blood pressure.

The process typically includes:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, normalization, and feature selection.

Model Selection: Algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Neural Networks are commonly used.

Training and Evaluation: Models are trained on labeled data and evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

Outcome: A well-performing model can assist healthcare professionals in early detection, potentially reducing the risk of complications through timely intervention.

Machine learning enhances diabetes prediction by uncovering patterns in data that may not be obvious to humans, leading to more efficient, scalable, and accurate diagnostic support.
